## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Most of this build was a practice of things I learned previously. I'm trying to keep the skills I've learned as well as learn new ones in the middle of searching for a job. I did get to play around with background elements in CSS which was quite fun. I also like getting to explore Flexbox columns, rows, and the reverse of each.

I am trying to think mostly in terms of ems and rems to make my projects as responsive as possible. That was a bit of a challenge in the beginning but overall, it worked out really well.

### Continued development

I want to continue to learn more about making my code responsive. I came across the max, min, and clamp CSS properties that I want to explore further.
